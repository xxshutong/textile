- Removed
  org.ofbiz.entity.connection.XaPoolConnectionFactory.java
  org.ofbiz.entity.connection.TyrexConnectionFactory.java

  They are excluded from compilation in original codebase and I didn't find
  a way to do the same. maven-comple-plugin <exludes/> doesn't work for me when
  package (but work when compile).

- commons-pool, commons-dbcp and ofbiz-minerva embed into bundle. Seems they are not
  used by other components.

- Version differences
  commons-dbcp-1.3		com.springsource.org.apache.commons.dbcp 1.2.2.osgi (Spring)
  commons-pool-1.3 		com.springsource.org.apache.commons.pool 1.5.3 (Spring)
